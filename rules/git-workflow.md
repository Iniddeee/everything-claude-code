# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Guidelines

1. **Atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
2. **Descriptive messages** - Explain why, not what
3. **Conventional commits** - Use: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
4. **Small PRs** - Keep pull requests focused and reviewable
5. **Branch naming** - feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/ prefixes
6. **Rebase before merge** - Keep history clean
7. **Review required** - No direct commits to main
8. **CI must pass** - All tests and checks must succeed
9. **Squash when appropriate** - Clean up commit history
10. **Sign commits** - Use GPG signatures for security
