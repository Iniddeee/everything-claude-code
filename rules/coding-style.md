# Coding Style Rules

## General Principles

1. **Readability over cleverness** - Write code for humans
2. **Consistency** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
3. **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
4. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
5. **YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It
6. **Single Responsibility** - One function, one purpose
7. **Meaningful names** - Variables and functions should be self-documenting
8. **Small functions** - Keep functions focused and short
9. **Immutability** - Prefer immutable data structures
10. **Error handling** - Handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
