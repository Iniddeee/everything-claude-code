# Testing Rules

## Testing Requirements

1. **80% minimum coverage** - Critical paths must have 100%
2. **Write tests first** - Follow TDD when possible
3. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what, not how
4. **Independent tests** - Tests should not depend on each other
5. **Fast tests** - Unit tests should run in milliseconds
6. **Clear test names** - Describe what is being tested
7. **AAA pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
8. **Mock external dependencies** - Keep tests isolated
9. **Test edge cases** - Don't just test happy paths
10. **Maintain tests** - Treat test code as production code
